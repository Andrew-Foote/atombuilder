# atombuilder

Allows a user to build up an atom by adding protons and neutrons, in order to facilitate understanding of atomic structure.

Historical context (added in 2022): This is possibly the oldest non-trivial program I wrote. From the last-modified date on my computer it looks like I wrote it back in 2009, not long after my 14th birthday. I think everything I tried to write before them was either completely trivial or too ambitious for my skill level at that time for me to get it in any kind of working state.
